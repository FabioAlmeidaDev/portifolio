                <p>During my time off I like to spend a few minutes (or hours) over at <a href="https://app.codesignal.com/profile/fabioalmeida" target="_blank" className="link">codesignal.com</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/FabioDAlmeida/" target="_blank" className="link">leetCode.com</a> working on my coding skills to stay sharp on my critical thinking while solving real world problems with computer programming. The links above will bring you to my profile and you can check out my rankings there, but if you just want a quick glimpse at how I code, Here are a few of my solutions:</p>

            <CodeItem title="All Longest Strings" image-src="./codesignal-solutions/longestStrings.png">
                Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings
                <h5>Example</h5>
                For inputArray = ["aba", "aa", "ad", "vcd", "aba"], the output should be allLongestStrings(inputArray) = ["aba", "vcd", "aba"].               
            </CodeItem>

            <CodeItem title="Almost Increasing Sequence" image-src="./codesignal-solutions/almostIncreasing.png">
                Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 &lt; a1 &lt; ... &lt; an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

            <CodeItem title="Shape Area" image-src="./codesignal-solutions/shapeArea.png">
            Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.
